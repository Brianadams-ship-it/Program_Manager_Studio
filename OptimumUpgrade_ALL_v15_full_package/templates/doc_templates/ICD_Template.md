# Interface Control Document (ICD) – Template

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Interface Control Document (ICD) defines the technical and operational interfaces between
major subsystems. It ensures a shared understanding between hardware, software, and external systems.

### 1.2 Scope
Describe which interfaces are covered by this document and which are out of scope.

### 1.3 References
List applicable specifications, standards, and related documents.

## 2. System Overview

Provide a short description of the overall system architecture and where each interfacing
subsystem fits within that architecture.

## 3. Interface Identification

### 3.1 Interface Inventory
Provide a table listing each interface with:
- Interface ID
- Source subsystem
- Destination subsystem
- Brief description

### 3.2 Interface Diagrams
Reference or include one or more diagrams that show key interfaces and data flows.

## 4. Interface Description

For each interface, provide subsections such as:

### 4.x.1 Functional Description
Describe what information or services are exchanged across the interface.

### 4.x.2 Data Definitions
Define messages, signals, or data elements. Include units, ranges, and formats.

### 4.x.3 Protocols and Timing
Describe communication protocols, timing requirements, and error handling.

### 4.x.4 Performance Requirements
Document any latency, throughput, or reliability requirements specific to the interface.

## 5. Electrical / Mechanical / Environmental (as applicable)

If relevant, describe electrical or mechanical characteristics and environmental constraints
for the interface (e.g., connector type, voltage levels, mounting interfaces).

## 6. Verification

Describe how each interface requirement will be verified (analysis, test, inspection, etc.)
and reference the relevant requirements and test cases in the Optimum Upgrade toolkits.

## 7. Change Control

Describe how interface changes are proposed, reviewed, and approved, including impacts to
connected subsystems and documentation updates.
